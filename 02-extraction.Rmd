# The Extraction Phase

Even while the obtaining of the data is not part of the analysis methodology, we have to point out that it is no trivial matter to obtain data to begin working with. It is important to note also that this part of the process depends completely upon the structure and contents of the portal. There is no way to design a general method for obtaining data because each database is constructed and obtained in its own way. Even so, we will try to explain what have we done in this particular case(mexican open government data stored in datos.gob.mx) in order to clear the path for future investigations.

## The CKAN system and its API

The data portal datos.gob.mx is built upon the design and functionalities of the CKAN system. To better explain how to use the portal, we first present a brief overview of CKAN, the definition of API and how it is related to our problem.

The first key concept is CKAN. Quoting from the CKAN website, "CKAN is a powerful data management system that makes data accessible â€“ by providing tools to streamline publishing, sharing, finding and using data. CKAN is aimed at data publishers (national and regional governments, companies and organizations) wanting to make their data open and available".

The second key topic is the concept of API. An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components.

Finally, we have to link these key ideas together: 

The portal datos.gob.mx is an implementation of the CKAN system which is a platform to publish open data and make it accesible. CKAN has many tools in order to accomplish the accesibility of the data: it has a tag system, a query system, and a way of organizing the databases that makes it very easy to find the desired data. To make it possible for a program to access the site, CKAN has a set of functions (called API) which allows a program to make use of the all the functionality that the site has.

## Keywords

The first step to obtain data is to try to guess the tags that are associated to the database. This a heuristic task for which we present a useful resource: list all the tags available in the site. This is most useful when you already know how to use the site (for which we mean knowing how to use the CKAN API), but you can use this tip querying on the search bar of the site.

Strictly speaking, it is actually difficult to list all the tags in the site without knowledge of the API. For this reason, we present a little help with the search.

In this link, we have already listed the all the databases available in the site and we have toggled on the option to list as many tags as possible. Unfortunately, not all the tags available appear in this webpage, but it is a good start to begin with.
The tags appear on the left side of the site right after the "Etiquetas" heading, which stands for "Tags".

## Discriminate the irrelevant entries

After listing all entries related to the query in the search bar, you have to take a look into the title of the resulting entries in order to know which of them are useful for your purposes. This is also a heuristic task because of the variety of ways in which related databases (or even the same database) can be registered. 

To avoid confusion, the titles are in bold and in a slightly bigger font size than the normal text. We present a screenshot to help in the identification.

`r knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/titles.png", dpi = NA)`

## Identifying the source of the data

The next step in the extraction is the identification of the source of the data. This means getting to know the name of the government dependency that published the data. Ideally, this is very easy mostly thanks to the CKAN system, because it requires the publisher to supply as many metadata as possible. In the reality, the missing metadata makes it very hard to find the real source of the data. 

This information is displayed at the left of the website after clicking in the entry title. As before, we present a screenshot to make it easier to find it.

`r knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/source.png", dpi = NA)`

## Download

After identifying the source of the data, you can finally download the database. We present a screenshot to point out the database link.

`r knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/database.png", dpi = NA)`

After accessing the website of the database, you can click on the link named "url" to preview the database in your web browser. You can save the file to disk directly from your browser.

`r knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/database1.png", dpi = NA)`

## Checking the data

As a final step in the extraction process, we recommend opening the file you have just downloaded with a plain text editor like Notepad, Gedit, etc. This will allow you to have a more concrete idea of the structure of the database as a preparation to the import process.
